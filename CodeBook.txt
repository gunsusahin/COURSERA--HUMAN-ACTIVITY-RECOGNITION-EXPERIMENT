COURSERA- HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION EXPERIMENT The data belongs to an experiment which aims to recognize human activities using accelerometer and gyroscope. These sensor signals were embedded in a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) which participants of the experiment put on their waist. Each participant performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing smartphones and signals were able to capture 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. From the obtained dataset, 70% of the volunteers’ data was randomly selected and used to generate the training data and with the rest of the 30% the test data was generated.VariablesThe main variables are the 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ filtered from the sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope). Other variables are created by further filtering of these signals and dividing those signals into body and gravity. XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.  2 columns were added;- “Subjects” column indicates the ids of the participants- “Activities” shows the name of the activity that corresponds to that particular measurement The complete list of variables are on the features.txt file. Other variable names can be found in detail in the features_info.txt. Below subset of 20 variables are given;* tBodyAcc_mean_X* tBodyAcc_mean_Y* tBodyAcc_mean_Z* tGravityAcc_mean_X* tGravityAcc_mean_Y* tGravityAcc_mean_Z* tBodyAccJerk_mean_X* tBodyAccJerk_mean_Y* tBodyAccJerk_mean_Z* tBodyGyro_mean_X* tBodyGyro_mean_Y* tBodyGyro_mean_Z* tBodyGyroJerk_mean_X* tBodyGyroJerk_mean_Y* tBodyGyroJerk_mean_Z* tBodyAccMag_mean* tGravityAccMag_mean* tBodyAccJerkMag_mean* tBodyGyroMag_mean* tBodyGyroJerkMag_meanAnalysis1) First, all relevant data files are read. Training data and test data are merged into one dataset.2) Column names are given according to the list of variables given in the features.txt file. 3) A subset of the data has been selected with the variables that only measures the mean or standard deviation of each observation.4) Numbers that represent the activities are replaced with activity labels(names) given in the activity_labels.txt file.5) “BodyBody” and “-“ was replaced with respectively “Body and “_”. Parentheses were removed.6) Another subset has been made by grouping the data by subject and activity, and the mean is calculated for every measurement column.7) The final dataset was written to a file summary_totaldata.txt.
